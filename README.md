Python GUI programming for Raspberry Pi
==========================================

### [Motivation]
- There are always complaints for organizing two teams in my Saturday morning soccer team. As a human being, it is very hard for the person in charge of organizing two teams to be fair enough to satisfy everyone. I decided to build a program for my team. It includes managing game plan and players, creating teams, managing records, and tracking individual records.

### [Requirement]
- Raspberry Pi 2+, Raspberry Pi 7" Touch screen, Portable Battery Pack
- Python 3.6+, PyQt5, sqlite3
